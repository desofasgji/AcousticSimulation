# Acoustic Simulation

This repository contains a Unity project for acoustic simulation which was created as part of a semester paper.
It uses [ResonanceAudio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/) for spacializing audio.
The demos included in the [Unity SDK](https://github.com/resonance-audio/resonance-audio-unity-sdk) were modified to fit the needs of the paper.
Their original SDK and source are licends under the `Apache License 2.0`, therefore this project is licensed under it aswell.
The modified and added asstes should all have been moved from the `ResonanceAudio` folder to the `AcousticRayTracing` folder.
